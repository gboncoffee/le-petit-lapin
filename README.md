# Le Petit Lapin

Le Petit Lapin is a X window manager written in Rust as a library. One must
create a binary Cargo crate that depends on `lapin` to build it with a desired
configuration.

The name "Le petit lapin" was choosen by a friend of mine and it means "The 
little bunny" in French, but I'm not 100% sure about that because I don't speak
French.

### This software is usable but lacks lots of features. Soon I'll make a release ;)

## TODO

- Fullscreen;
- A bar;
- EWMH.
